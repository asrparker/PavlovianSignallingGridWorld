# PavlovianSignallingGridWorld

GridWorldMain is the main code.
It is a linear gridworld where the agent is trying to learn to avoid the extreme ends of the space while moving from one side to the other of the linear world.

GridWorldTrial operates as GridWorldMain, but outputs a csv file.

dynamic_plotterm is a real-time visualizer from Jaden Travnik

kanerva is an alternate method of function approximation, selective kanerva coding, from Jaden Travnik. Not implimented here

learn contains several methods of reinforcement learning that can initialized and used.

This was used to verify for myself that GTD does not forget in a fully artificial environment
